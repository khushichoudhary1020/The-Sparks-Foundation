# IPL Data Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset. As part of my internship at The Sparks Foundation, this analysis aims to uncover insightful patterns, trends, and statistics about the IPL matches and player performances. The analysis is done using Python, leveraging libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Introduction

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is one of the biggest cricket leagues globally, featuring teams from various cities in India. This project explores the IPL dataset to analyze matches, team performances, player statistics, and more. The primary goal is to utilize EDA techniques to gain a deeper understanding of the data and present findings in a meaningful way.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and includes detailed information on IPL matches and deliveries. The main files are:

- `ipl_data.csv`: Contains match details such as match ID, season, winner, venue, and more.

Download the dataset from Kaggle: [IPL Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushichoudhary1020/ipl-dataset)

## Installation

To run this analysis, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

Alternatively, you can run this analysis in a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab, where these libraries are typically pre-installed.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IPL-EDA.git
cd IPL-EDA
```

2. **Upload the Dataset:**

Ensure the `ipl_data.csv` file is in the same directory as your notebook or script.

3. **Run the Analysis:**

Open the `IPL_EDA.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or Colab and run the cells to perform the analysis.

## Analysis

The analysis includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:**
   - Importing necessary libraries.
   - Loading the dataset.
   - Checking for and handling missing values.

2. **Data Exploration:**
   - Understanding the basic structure and summary of the data.

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Visualizing team performance, including most wins by teams and matches played each season.
   - Analyzing player performance, identifying top run-scorers and wicket-takers.

## Key Insights

From the visualizations and analysis, the following key insights were drawn:

- **Top Performing Teams:** Identification of teams with the most wins over the seasons.
- **Player Performance:** Identification of top run-scorers and wicket-takers.
- **Season Trends:** Trends in the number of matches played each season.

## Conclusion

This project provided a comprehensive understanding of IPL matches and player performances. It demonstrated the power of data visualization in uncovering patterns and trends, highlighting the importance of EDA in data science projects.
